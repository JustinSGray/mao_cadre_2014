  \section{Motivation}

    Many of today's the most intersting design problems involve very large design spaces with 100's or 1000's of 
    design variables. Large design spaces are often approached through the use of gradient based optimziation 
    analytic derivatives to achieve highly scalable solution stratgies. For instance, adjoint based gradient 
    methods have allowed CFD based shape optimization to tackle problems with 100's of design varibles. [Cite Juan's Groups
    work here]. Coupled Aero-structural optimziation is another area where gradient based optimization methods have 
    been employed. [Cite Martins groups work here]. Although these problems have large design spaces, 
    they include only a few disciplines (i.e. Geometry, Aerodynamics, Structures). The relative simplicity of 
    the problem formulation make it feasible to use custom implementations taylored to a specific problem. These specific 
    implemnetations make it difficult to modify the problem formulation without significant effort. For problems 
    with more disciplines customs solutions become less feasible, and a more general means of setting up 
    the design problem is required. 

    In this work we demonstrate how OpenMDAO, an open-source MDAO framework, can provide a more general 
    solution to constructing and solving complex problems with large design spaces. Use of OpenMDAO 
    provides benefits in a number of important respects: 

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Combining analytic derivatives with finite difference in a mixed derivatives environment
      \item Automatic and efficient solving for the coupled derivatives at the system level 
      \item Automatic assembly of the full gradient from the partial derivatives of each discipline
      \item Flexbility via separation of problem formulation from solution strategy 
      \item Improved ability to modify/grow a problem with additional disciplines
    \end{enumerate}
