Note: all trajectories in all maps are colored according to bitrate.

MAPS:
==========

allpts_gearth.png - Google Earth overlay of trajectories of all design points, ground-station centered

allpts_gearth2.png - Google Earth overlay of trajectories of all design points, showing ground and polar region

allpts_map_data.png - Google Maps overlay of trajectories of all design points, zoomed in to US, with bitrate color scale included.

color_scale_data.png - Copy of the bitrate data color scale, for inserting into figures as needed.

pt0_map.png - Google Maps overlay of CADRE trajectory during in the first design point timeframe. Used plain view because the color for the zero bitrate level kind of gets mixed in to the ocean in a satellite view.

pt3_map.png - Google Maps overlay of CADRE trajectory during in the 4th design point timeframe.

pt3_gearth1.png - Google Earth overlay of CADRE trajectory during in the 4th design point timeframe (pt3).

pt3_gearth2.png - Google Earth overlay of CADRE trajectory during in the 4th design point timeframe (pt3).

pt3_gearth3.png - Google Earth overlay of CADRE trajectory during in the 4th design point timeframe (pt3).

pt3_gearth4.png - Google Earth overlay of CADRE trajectory during in the 4th design point timeframe (pt3).


DATA PLOTs:
===========

All data plots show the following variables over the course of each design pt:
    1: Data bit rate, Dr
    2: Comm power level, P_comm
    3: Body roll angle, gamma
    4: Battery state of charge, SOC

Plots are given for all 6 CADRE design points, pt0 through pt5.
